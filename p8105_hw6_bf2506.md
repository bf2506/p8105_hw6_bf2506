library(tidyverse)
```

### Problem 2

``` r
homi_data = 
  read.csv("./data/homicide-data.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names()
```

Create a city_state variable, and a binary result variable of
disposition. Omit cities Dallas, TX; Phoenix, AZ; and Kansas City, MO –
these don’t report victim race. Also omit Tulsa, AL – this is a data
entry mistake. For this problem, limit your analysis those for whom
victim_race is white or black. Be sure that victim_age is numeric.

``` r
homi_data = 
  homi_data %>% 
  mutate(city_state = paste(city, state, sep = ", ", collapse = NULL)) %>% 
  mutate(result = ifelse(disposition == "Closed by arrest", 1, 0),
         victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age)) %>%
  relocate(uid, city_state, everything()) %>% 
  filter( !(city_state %in% c("Dallas,TX", "Phoenix,AZ", " Kansas City,MO", "Tulsa,AL")) &
    victim_race %in% c("Black", "White"))
```
